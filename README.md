People Demo - a prototype people object repository
=====================================================

This repository contains static website content for a 
proof of concept tool for curating people identity objects
as used in various Caltech Library metadata records.


## Goals

+ Manage the unique id mappings for people in the various Caltech Library repositories (e.g. ORCID or VIAF to internal identifiers)

Introduction
------------

[people-demo](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/people-demo) 
is a static website implementation use in conjunction with the 
[And/Or](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/andor) web service
for curating unique id mapping for a set of individuals affiliated
with Caltech publications.  It is built on a prototype of a 
multi-user version of [dataset](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset) 
called [And/Or](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/andor). It can run
on very small machines[^1] and in tiny virtual machine environments 
like those available on AWS EC2[^2].


Installation
------------

The website implementation depends on the following software

+ A front end web server like Apache 
    + Need to provide reverse proxy to/from __And/Or__ service
    + Provide/require authentication (e.g. BasicAUTH, Shibboleth, Open ID Connect)
    + secure transport (e.g. https via TLS or OpenSSL)
+ [Golang v1.13](https://golang.org)
+ [mkpage](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/mkpage)
+ [dataset](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset)
+ [And/Or](https://github.com/caltechlibrary/andor)

Refer to [Apache.org](https://apache.org) for how to install configure 
Apache, instructions for installing __mkpage__ can be found at https://caltechlibrary.github.io/mkpage, __dataset__ can be found at
https://caltechlibrary.github.io/dataset and for __And/Or__ at
https://github.com/caltechlibrary/andor.

For __mkpage__, __dataset__, and __And/Or__ if you have Golang version
1.13 installed you can do something like--

```bash
    export GOPATH="${HOME}"
    go get -u github.com/caltechlibrary/mkpage/...
    go get -u github.com/caltechlibrary/dataset/...
    go get -u github.com/caltechlibrary/andor/...
```

Known issues and limitations
----------------------------

This is website is a prototype and not intended for production. 
The purpose of it is to serve as a starting point for what
a People Object repository might look like and work like for
Caltech Library.
